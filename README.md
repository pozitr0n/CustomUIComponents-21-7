## Project mini-game "Circles"

### Game requirements:
* Single screen application
* Round objects on the screen
* The number of objects on the screen is from three to seven
* Objects can be dragged
* Objects interact with each other and their sizes depend on actions:
* We drag the blue circle to the blue circle.
* The circle on which the object is dragged changes color to dark blue and increases in size.
* Therefore, the circle that was dragged disappears as such.
* Animation is not required (but I did it as best I could, because without it it looks completely ugly)

### An example of the application is shown in the figures below:
